# ANSER Web v2

Independent web product — not part of the ANSER Flask codebase (`ban-le` / `gateway` / `san-xuat`).
Single Next.js app: pages + API routes (Route Handlers) in one project.

## Structure

```
ANSER-web-v2/
└── frontend/   Next.js (TypeScript, App Router, Tailwind) — UI + /api/* backend
```

## Run locally

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev         # http://localhost:3000 (UI + API on the same origin)
```

Copy `frontend/.env.local.example` to `frontend/.env.local` and set `JWT_SECRET`.

## Notes

- The Flask apps (`ban-le`, `gateway`, `san-xuat` in `ANSER_ban-le_gateway/`) are a separate,
  unrelated codebase — this project only borrows product ideas/data model concepts from ANSER,
  it does not call into or depend on their code.
- User data is currently stored in-memory (`frontend/src/lib/store/users.ts`) — resets on
  every server restart. Will move to Neon Postgres later; the store's exported functions are
  written so only that one file needs to change.
